## Notes
#### Technologies: JavaScript
### Week 7 pair programming project for [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com)
[Outline](#outline) | [User Stories](#user-stories) | [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions) 

## Brief
Build a notes app as a frontend, single page web app.

(NB: notes do not need to be permanently stored. If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.)

## Outline
This challenge involved the creation of a single page note taking app in vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks or testing libraries.

The first task was to create our own testing framework from scratch.  Once this was functional, we were able to test drive the application, guided by the user stories below.

## User Stories
```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

## Usage Instructions

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/samjones1001/note
$ cd note
```
* run tests
Open spec_file.html in your browser and open the console.
